# Local Course Seat Notification
## Overview
Using calls to [NUBanner](https://nubanner.neu.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/registration) and 
[Discord Webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks), tracks the student 
enrollment count of selected classes, then notifies the user when a seat opens up. 

This was completed through the help of NU Sandbox's API documentation as well as my own exploration of the API calls 
made by banner through the Network tab. You can find Sandbox's API documentation 
[here](https://jennydaman.gitlab.io/nubanned/dark.html#studentregistrationssb-clickcontinue-post). Massive thanks to 
their extensive writeup.
